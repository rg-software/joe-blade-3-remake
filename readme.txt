HISTORY AND GAME DESCRIPTION

Joe Blade 3 Remake is based on the original game Joe Blade 3, which is copyright 1989 by Players Software. Joe Blade 3 was available at least on Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum home computers.

Joe Blade 3 offers an amazing action in a building, containing 31 floors + roof (which gives you 542 locations in total). Your mission includes several objectives:

1) save 6 hostages;
2) capture enemy leader Crax Bloodfinger;
3) rig 6 explosives to blow up the building;
4) escape via the roof.

Basically, you can complete objectives in any order, but beware: you have only 10 minutes to finish your task after any explosive is rigged!

There are also three (similar, but, anyway, different) types of subgames. Their rules you have to figure out yourself in order to complete the game :)


REMAKE FEATURES

- significantly improved graphics;
- faithful gameplay;
- in-game save/load feature;
- smooth scrolling (in addition to faithful room-based action);
- a jukebox with 14 great soundtracks, including music from original Joe Blade game series.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES

The normal speed for the game is 25 frames per second. If your system produces 25 or more FPS, it is acceptable. At least, any 400 MHz or faster computer with 15-20 Mb of free RAM should be enough.
There are several "standard" command-line switches:

/f   - fullscreen mode
/fps - show FPS
/se  - enable smooth scrolling 
/ns  - no sound
/dj  - disable jukebox

There are also some switches you can use for cheating :) (the one who wants to cheat will find a way in any case):

/ie  - infinite energy
/ia  - infinite ammo
/t   - stop all timers
/l   - get all liftcards
/kd  - get 50 keys and disks

Instead of using command-line switches, you can set the options with the tool Configure.exe.


CONTROLS

Movement: cursor keys.
Fire: space bar.
Jukebox on/off: Ctrl key.
Play another track: Shift key.
